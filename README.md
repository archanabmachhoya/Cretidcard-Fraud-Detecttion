# Cretidcard-Fraud-Detecttion

The objective of this project is to create a simple Logistic Regression model capable of detecting fraud 
in credit card operations, thus seeking to minimize the risk and loss of the business. The biggest 
challenge is to create a model that is very sensitive to fraud and unbalanced data, which is resolved with 
SMOTE Technique. Using the GridSearchCV technique obtained the best hyperparameters to get the best 
Machine Learning Model.
